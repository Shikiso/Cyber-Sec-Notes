# Local Area Network
LAN is a connection of devices who can communicate with one another.
There are multiple topologies such as:
## Star Topology
All devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch (or not so common a hub). This is the most common topology found due to its reliability and scalability.

## Bus Topology
Relies on a single connection which is known as a backbone cable. This one is similar to a leaf off a tree in sense that the devices (leaves) stem from where the branches are on this cable.

## Ring Topology
Devices are connected directly to each other to form a loop, meaning there is little cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a start topology.

# Switch
A switch is a dedicated device within a network that help devices communicate with one another. The devices plug into the switches port via Ethernet cables and using MAC addresses the switch will decide where packets are being sent and forward them to the desired location.
# Router
A router connects network to each other. Allowing devices from different LANs connect to one another. This big connection of LANs is calls a WAN. Routers use IP addresses to decide where to send packets.
