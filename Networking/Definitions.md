NIC (Network Interface Card) - Connects device to physical network

Logical Topology - Lets you see IP addresses and which devices are connection and what media is being used
Physical Topology - Illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation (Can see the physical location of networks, switches, routers, racks(servers))

Internet means network of networks
peer to peer network: In small businesses and homes, many computers function a both the servers clients on the network.

Local Area Networks (LAN)
	- Used in a department within a home or small business
	- Interconnect end devices in a limited area
	- Usually administered by a single organization or individual
	- Provide high-speed bandwidth to internal end devices

Wide Area Networks (WAN)
	- An network infrastructure that provides access to other networks over a wide
	geographical area, usually owned by a larger corporation or a telecommunications service provider
	- WANs interconnect LANs over a wide geographical area (cities, states)
	- Usually administered by multiple service providers
	- Typically provide slower speed links between LANs

Intranet - Refers to a private connection of LANs and WANs that belong to an organization
Extranet - Provides secure and safe access to individuals who work for a different organization  but require access to the organizations data

Intranet - Company Only
Extranet - Suppliers, Customers, Collaborators

Cable - Typically offered by cable television service providers, the internet data signal transmits on the same cable that delivers cable television. It provides a high bandwidth, high availability, and an always-on connection to the internet.

DSL - Digital Subscriber Lines also provide high bandwidth, high availability, and an always-on connection to the internet. DSL runs over a telephone line. In general, small office and home office users connect using Asymmetrical DSL (ADSL), which means that the download speed is faster than the upload speed.

Cellular - Cellular internet access uses a cell phone network to connect. Wherever you can get a cellular signal, you can get cellular internet access. Performance is limited by the capabilities of the phone and the cell tower to which it is connected.
Satellite - The availability of satellite internet access is a benefit in those areas that would otherwise have no internet connectivity at all. Satellite dishes require a clear line of sight to the satellite.

Dial-up Telephone - An inexpensive option that uses any phone line and a modem. The low bandwidth provided by a dial-up modem connection is not sufficient for large data transfer, although it is useful for mobile access while traveling.

Dedicated Leased Line - Leased lines are reserved circuits within the service providerâ€™s network that connect geographically separated offices for private voice and/or data networking. The circuits are rented at a monthly or yearly rate.

Metro Ethernet - This is sometimes known as Ethernet WAN. In this module, we will refer to it as Metro Ethernet. Metro ethernets extend LAN access technology into the WAN. Ethernet is a LAN technology you will learn about in a later module.

Business DSL - Business DSL is available in various formats. A popular choice is Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL) which is similar to the consumer version of DSL but provides uploads and downloads at the same high speeds.

Satellite - Satellite service can provide a connection when a wired solution is not available.

Tradition Separate Networks - A bunch of networks that can't communicate with one another (Data Network, Telephone Network, Video Network)

Converged Networks - A Network that can communicate together, can send data, voice and video through the same network infrastructure

The internet uses redundant connections, so if a link fails data i sent through a alternative one

Networks tend to use Quality of Server policy to maintain a smooth uninterrupted experience.
Web pages usually receive a lower priority where a voice over IP (VoIP) will have a high priority


Confidentiality - Data confidentiality means that only the intended and authorized recipients can access and read data.

Integrity - Data integrity assures users that the information has not been altered in transmission, from origin to destination.

Availability - Data availability assures users of timely and reliable access to data services for authorized users.

Intermediary Devices - Interconnects end devices (routers, switch, wireless access point)

IDF - Intermediate Distribution Frame is a cable rack in a central office that connects and manages the IT or telecommunications
cabling between a MDF

MDF - Main Distribution Frame is a primary hub or demarcation point that interconnects private or public IT and telecommunication
lines coming to a building to an internal network.

Protocol - Agreed set of rules

response timeout - manages how long a device waits when it does not hear a reply from the destination

flow control - manages the rate of the data transmission and defines how much information can be sent and the speed at which it can be sent.

suite - combination of protocols

sequencing - merging packets to send multiple packets

encapsulation - packing
de-encapsulation - unpacking

Duel Stack - have both IPv4/6 protocols running on same network

Tunneling - method of transporting an IPv6 packet over IPv4 network

Translation - Network address translation 64 (NAT64) allows IPv6 devices to communicate with IPv4 devices

Anycast - A IPv6 address assigned to multiple devices.

Network Segment - Group of computers connected using a shared medium

subnetwork - one or more network segments connected together and configured to use the same router
