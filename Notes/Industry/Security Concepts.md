# Controls
A control is a security mechanism that is implemented to increase security or make up for a shortfall in security. Controls can be technical solutions, processes, procedures, policies or physical controls.

In theory controls are categorized into three broad areas:
**Administrative/Managerial Controls:** Applies through policies and procedures
**Technical/Logical Controls:** Firewalls, file/folder permissions, encryption, etc
**Physical/Operational Controls:** Physical security issues, locked doors, gates, cameras
# Defense-in-Depth
Defense-in-Depth also known as layered security is a security technique that relies on having multiple layers of security. For example having a firewall is good and all but what happens once someone bypasses it. If you have no other security measures the attacker has can do as they please.
# Data Sensitivity and Classification
Data is important and needs to be secured. But there is no point spending more money on securing data than the data itself is worth. Securing everything to be absolutely impenetrable will have you end up wasting money and losing some functionality. Hence you should only secure your most important data to the highest level and only secure not so important data and much as necessary.

For example a bank would want all banking information such as names, addresses, TFNs, credit cards to be as secure as possible since this data is highly valuable and should never be exposed. But information such as how much money someone has is important sure but not as important and the credit card information that allows someone to access this money. Hence it wont need as much security as the credit card information.
# Principle of Least Privilege 
All employees no matter if they are interns or senior executives should have the lest amount of privileges grants possible. This is to ensure no one can do things they should not be able to do.
# Separation of Duties
No single individual should perform all critical or privileged tasks. Important duties should be split at a minimum among two people and require checks and balances. 
# Multi-Person Control
More than one person is required to accomplish a specific task or function. This is implemented to ensure that one person by themselves can not initiate an action that would cause detrimental consequences for the organization.
# Mandatory Vacations
This concepts requires individuals to take vacations at various times of the year so that another individual can fulfill the vacationers responsibilities and their duties can be audited.
# Job Rotation
Switching people around to work in different positions enabling them to become proficient in a variety of positions. Making it so that the organization does not rely on one single person to complete a set of tasks.
# Due Diligence and Due Care
Think responsibly (due diligence) and act responsibly (due care).
