C.I.A triad is regarded as the most valid model of security.
It includes three different main principles, those being confidentiality, integrity and availability. These three principles are required for ensuring the security of any system.

# Confidentiality
Ensures no individual can view or access resources without authorization

The most common ways of maintaining confidentiality are:
- **Steganography**: A technique for hiding any piece of important info in the form of a simple image or text
- **Cryptography**: A technique of encryption and decryption using secretive keys
- **Access  control**: Prevents any form on unauthorized access 

# Integrity
Assurance of completeness and trustworthiness and accuracy of information.

Three primary ways in which organizations ensure the integrity of their data are:
- **Hashing**: Combining the function of hash along with a secret key which is shared
- **Validation of Input**: Validating or also restricting those values which are entered by the users.
- **Digital Signature**: Mathematics that ensures there is no type of alteration or modification in the sent message.

# Availability
Ensure resources you want available are available and can be used in a efficient manner without compromising the security.
