# Database Tables
A database table contains columns and records (rows but with a different name).
Each column is identified by its name and the records it contains is its data. The table itself will have a name which is how you will identify where you're getting the data from.

| column1   | column2   | column3   |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| record1.1 | record1.2 | record1.3 |
| record2.1 | record2.2 | record2.3 |

| ID  | Name | DoB       |
| --- | ---- | --------- |
| 0   | John | 22/9/2000 |
| 1   | Kyle | 10/2/1999 |
| 2   | Ryan | 2/12/2003 |
