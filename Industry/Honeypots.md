A honeypot is a network attached system designed to lure in threat actors and monitor their activities. This helps professionals understand or study attacks used to gain sensitive information.

Honeypots are placed within a network to improve their resilience to cyber attacks.
In the event of an attack, if the attack was undetected by protective devices such as firewalls and IPSs. The attacker would be observed by the honeypot trying to pivot around the network looking for something of value.

Once the honeypot is attacked it will send its logs to a server (for instance Splunk) which will have preconfigured alerts letting the analysts know they have a breach. The analysts can then work backwards to find the threat.
