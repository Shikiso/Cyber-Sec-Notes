| Costs are resource-specific. Meaning the usage that a meter tracks and the numbr of meters associated with a resource, depend on the resource type.<br> | With a pay-as-you-go model, consumption is one of the biggest drivers costs. | Monitoring your Azure footprint and maintaining your environment can help you identify and mitigate costs that arenâ€™t necessary, such as shutting down underused virtual machines.<br> | The same resource type can cost different amounts depending on the geographic area, which has an impact on Azure costs.<br> | While some inbound data transfers are free, the cost for outbound data or data between Azure resources is impacted by billing zones. | The type and configuration of your subscription can also impact your cost. For example, the free trial lets you explore some Azure resources for free. |
Using tools such as the pricing calculator and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator you can estimate cost savings and help with estimating costs of products.

# Governance and Compliance
## Azure Policy
Policy helps enforce standards and to access compliance at scale. Provides governance and resource consistency with regulatory compliance, security, cost and management.

## Resource Locks
Protects your resources from accidental deletion or modification.
Manages locks at subscription, resource group or individual resource levels.

## Manage resource locks
1. Create a resource
2. Add a ReadOnly resource lock to prevent resource modification
3. Update lock and retest
4. Remove the resource lock
5. Delete the resource
