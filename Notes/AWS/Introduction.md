Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, etc via the internet. Servers hosted in different regions/locations owned by a company providing users with the described resources.

# Cloud Service Models
**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
- Networking
- Computers/VMs
- Storage
**Platform as a service (PaaS)**
- Hardware
- Operating System
**Software as a service (SaaS)**
- End-user applications
- Web-based email application

# Cloud Computing Deployment Models
**Cloud** - All parts of your application will be running in the cloud.
**Hybrid** - Connects existing infrastructure to the cloud
**On-Premises/Private Cloud** - Using virtualization and resource management tools which can be used to provide dedicated resources.
