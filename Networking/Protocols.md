## Hybrid Protocol
A hybrid protocol is a protocol that combines features or techniques from two or more different types of protocols, taking advances of each ones strength.
## SMB 
(Uses TCP)
Server Message Block Protocol (SMB) is a client-server communication protocol 
used for sharing access to file, printers, serial ports, etc on a network.

Is a response-request protocol, meaning it can transmit multiple messages between
the client and server to establish a connection.


## Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)

- Usually blocked due to security reasons
- Available for IPv4 (ICMPv4) and IPv6 (ICMPv6)
- Used to test reachability of a host

ICMPv6 has 4 new protocols as part of the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (ND or NDP)
Messaging between an IPv6 router and host:
	Router Solicitation (RS) message - IPv6-enable router will send RA message in response to RS message
	Router Advertisement (RA) message - Sent every 200s to provide addressing info to IPv6-enables hosts.
Between IPv6 devices:
	Neighbor Solicitation (NS) message - To ensure a IPv6 address is unique the device will send a NS message with its own address as the target address. If another device has the address a NA message will be sent.
	Neighbor Advertisement (NA) message - Used to find out MAC address when IPv6 unicast address is known

If a host/gateway receives a packet that it cant deliver. It uses an
ICMP Destination Unreachable message to notify the source that service/destination
is unavailable.

Destination Unreachable codes for ICMPv4s:
	0 - Net unreachable
	1 - Host unreachable
	2 - Protocol unreachable
	3 - Port unreachable

Destination Unreachable codes for ICMPv6:
	0 - No route to destination
	1 - Communication with the destination is administratively prohibited (e.g., firewall)
	2 - Beyond scope of the source address
	3 - Address unreachable
	4 - Port unreachable


## HTTP/s:
	- When a URL is typed into a web browser the web browser establishes a connection to a web service
	- When a client sends request to a web server, HTTP specifies the message type for the communication
	- GET: Request Data
	- POST: Uploads data files
	- PUT: Uploads resources

## Email:
### SMTP:
		- Require header and body message
		- When client sends email client SMTP is connected with server SMTP on port 25.
		- After the connection is made the client attempts to send email to the server
		- When the server receives the message it either places the message in a local account or
			forwards the message to another mail server for delivery
		- If dst server unavailable SMTP spools messages to be sent at a later time.
		- The server checks this queue and attempts to send again
		- If unavailable to send after a predetermined time it is returned as undeliverable
### POP:
		- Application used to retrieve mail from mail server
		- When mail is downloaded from the server to the client it is deleted from the server
		- server starts POP service by listening on TCP port 110 for client connection requests
		- When connection is established the POP sends a greeting and the client exchanges commands
			and responses
		- POP does not store messages so it can not have backups
### IMAP:
		- Method to retrieve email messages
		- Copies of messages are downloaded to client application

SMTP functions between the senders device and the receivers mailbox.
	- Sends email from senders device to receivers mailbox
POP3 functions between the receiver and receivers mail server
	- Retrieves and organizes emails from the receivers mail server to the receivers device

DNS used to convert domain names into IP addresses.
DNS client service on Win also stores previously resolved names in mem (ipconfig /displaydns)
To get IP address:
	- Client will make request for website
	- If IP is not known client will ask closest DNS server
	- IF DNS server doesn't know it will ask the ROOT DNS
	- Will loop asking DNS servers until IP is found
	- Will then make request to IP NOT domain


A - An end device IPv4 address
NS - An authoritative name server
AAAA - An end device IPv6 address (pronounced quad-A)
MX - A mail exchange record

"nslookup" allows users to manually query the name servers to find a host


Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):
	- Automates the assigned of IPv4 addresses, subnets and gateways
	- The alternative is static addressing
	- When a host connects to a network the DHCP is contacted and a address is requested
	- DHCP server chooses an address from a configured range and leases it to the host
	- Lease period is the amount of time a host can have an IP address
	- When the lease expires the DHCP server gets a DHCPRELEASE message and the address is returned

DHCP Operation:
	- When the client connects to a network the client broadcasts DHCPDISCOVER message
	- A DHCP server on the network replies DHCPOFFER which offers a lease to the client

FTP:
	- Used to transfer files
	- Allows transfer between server and client
	- Port 21 for control traffic
	- Port 20 to transfer data

Server Message Block (SMB):
	- Client/Server file sharing protocol
	- 3 functions
		- Start, authenticate and terminate sessions
		- Control file and printer access
		- Allow an application to send or receive messages to or from another device
