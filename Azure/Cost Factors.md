The operation cost can be affected by many factors such as:
- Resource Types
- Consumption
- Maintenance
- Geography
- Subscription type
- Azure marketplace
# Resource Types
Multiple factors affect the cost of Azure resources such as the:
- Type
- Setting
- Region
When you provision a Azure resources, Azure creates metered instance for that resource.

# Consumption
Pay-as-you-go has been a consistent theme throughout, and that’s the cloud payment model where you pay for the resources that you use during a billing cycle. If you use more compute this cycle, you pay more. If you use less in the current cycle, you pay less. It’s a straight forward pricing mechanism that allows for maximum flexibility.

# Maintenance
Make sure you not using resources you don't need.

# Geography
Resource costs alter depending on the region. For example using a resource in a region further away will cost more than one close by.

# Subscription Type
Some Azure subscription types also include usage allowances, which affect costs.

# Azure Marketplace
Azure Marketplace lets you purchase Azure-based solutions and services from third-party vendors. This could be a server with software preinstalled and configured, or managed network firewall appliances, or connectors to third-party backup services. When you purchase products through Azure Marketplace, you may pay for not only the Azure services that you’re using, but also the services or expertise of the third-party vendor. Billing structures are set by the vendor.
