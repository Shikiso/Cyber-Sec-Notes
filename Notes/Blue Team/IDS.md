A IDS or Intrusion Detection System is used to detect any malicious traffic that has bypassed the firewall.

# Types
An IDS's main categorization depends on its deployment and detection modes.
## Deployment Modes
**Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)**: Installed individually on the hosts and are responsible for only detecting potential security threats associated with that particular host.
**Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)**: Monitor network traffic of all hosts involved to detect suspicious actives.
# Detection Modes
**Signature-Based IDS**: Each attack has its unique pattern, which is known as a signature. If the same attack happens it gets detected by its signature.
**Anomaly-Based IDS**: First learns normal behavior of the network or system and performs detections if there is any deviation from the normal behavior.
**Hybrid IDS**: Combines the detection methods of signature-based IDS and anomaly-based IDS to leverage the strengths of each approach.
