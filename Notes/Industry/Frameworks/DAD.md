The security of a system is attacked through one of several means. It can be via disclosure of secret data, alteration of data or destruction of data.
- **Disclosure** is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
- **Alteration** is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
- **Destruction/Denial** is the opposite of Availability.

The opposite of the CIA Triad would be the DAD Triad: Disclosure, Alteration and Destruction.
