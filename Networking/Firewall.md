A firewall is a device within a network responsible for determining what traffic is allowed to enter and exit. There are multiple types of firewalls, such as hardware enterprise ones to simple routers like what you have in your home.
Firewalls operate on the Network and Transport layer of the OSI model.

| Stateful              | This type of firewall uses the entire information from a connection; rather than inspecting an individual packet, this firewall determines the behaviour of a device **based upon the entire connection**.<br><br>This firewall type consumes many resources in comparison to stateless firewalls as the decision making is dynamic. For example, a firewall could allow the first parts of a TCP handshake that would later fail.<br><br>If a connection from a host is bad, it will block the entire device.                                                                                                                                      |
| Stateless             | This firewall type uses a static set of rules to determine whether or not **individual packets** are acceptable or not. For example, a device sending a bad packet will not necessarily mean that the entire device is then blocked.<br><br>Whilst these firewalls use much fewer resources than alternatives, they are much dumber. For example, these firewalls are only effective as the rules that are defined within them. If a rule is not exactly matched, it is effectively useless.<br><br>However, these firewalls are great when receiving large amounts of traffic from a set of hosts (such as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack) |
