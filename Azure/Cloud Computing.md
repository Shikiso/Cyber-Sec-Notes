Cloud computing is the delivery of services over the internet.

# Private cloud
Organizations create cloud environments in their data center. They are responsible for operating the services they provide.
Private cloud does not provide access to users outside the organization.

# Public cloud
Owned by cloud services or hosting provider.
Provides resources and services to multiple organizations/users.
This can be accessed by secure network connection.

# Hybrid cloud
Combines both public and private clouds to allow applications to run in the most appropriate location.

# Model comparison
| Public Cloud                                               | Private Cloud                                                         | Hybrid Cloud                                                       |

| No capital expenditures to scale up.                       | Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.<br>          | Provides the most flexibility.<br><br>                             |
| Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned. | Organizations have complete control over resources and security. <br> | Organizations determine where to run their applications.           |
| Organizations pay only for what they use.                  | Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates.   | Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements. |

# CapEx vs OpEx
| Capital Expenditure (CapEx)                               | Operational Expenditure (OpEx)                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The upfront spending of money on physical infrastructure. | Spend on products and services as needed, <br>pay-as-you-go. |
| Costs from CapEx have a value that reduces over time.     | pay-as-you-go. <br>                                          |

# Consumption-based model
Cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they use.
This allows for better cost prediction, prices for individual resources and services are provides and billing is based on the actual usage.

# Cloud Benefits
1. High availability
2. Scalability
3. Predictability
4. Governance
5. Elasticity
6. Reliability
7. Security
8. Manageability

# Cloud Service Types
## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Build pay-as-you-go IT infrastructure by renting servers, virtual machines, storage, networks and operating systems from a cloud provider.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Provide an environment for building, testing and deploying software applications; without focusing on managing underlying infrastructure.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)
Users connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet: for example, Microsoft Office 365, email and calendars.
