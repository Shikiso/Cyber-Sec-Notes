## System auditing
A systematic review of system logs, settings, and configurations to ensure compliance with security policies and best practices.
## Red/Blue Team Simulations
Simulated cyber attacks (Red Team) and defenses (Blue Team) to evaluate an organizationâ€™s readiness and resilience.
## Compliance Reviews and Mitigation Plans
Ensuring that systems and practices align with regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001, Essential 8) and developing strategies to address gaps.
## Incident Response Projects
Handling and investigating security breaches, minimizing damage, and restoring operations.
## Security Infrastructure Projects
Handling and investigating security breaches, minimizing damage, and restoring operations.
## Awareness and Training Projects
Handling and investigating security breaches, minimizing damage, and restoring operations.

# Methodologies
## Waterfall
A sequential design process where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. This linear approach is straightforward but can be rigid when changes are needed.
## Agile
An iterative and incremental approach that promotes flexibility and customer feedback. It breaks projects into small, manageable units called iterations or sprints, allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation.
## Scrum
An iterative and incremental approach that promotes flexibility and customer feedback. It breaks projects into small, manageable units called iterations or sprints, allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation.
## Kanban
An iterative and incremental approach that promotes flexibility and customer feedback. It breaks projects into small, manageable units called iterations or sprints, allowing for frequent reassessment and adaptation.
