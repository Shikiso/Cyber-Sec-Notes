Vulnerability scanning is the inspection of digital systems to find weaknesses.
Vulnerability scans can be categorized into many types. The major categorization of theses scans are explained below.

# Authenticated vs Unauthenticated Scans
Authenticated scans require the subject host's credentials and are more detailed than unauthenticated scans. These types of scans are helpful for discovering the threat surface within the host. However, unauthenticated scans are conducted without providing any credentials of the subject host. These scans help identify the threat surface from outside the host.

|Authenticated Scans|Unauthenticated Scans|
|---|---|
|The credentials of the subject host must be provided to the vulnerability scanner.|The vulnerability scanner does not require the host’s credentials; it only needs the IP address.|
|Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attackers having access to the host.|Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an external attacker having no access to the subject host.|
|It provides a deeper visibility into the target system by scanning its configuration and installed applications.|It is less resource-intensive and straightforward to set up.|
|For example, scanning an internal database by providing its credentials to the vulnerability scanner.|For example, scanning a public-facing website for vulnerabilities that any user can exploit.|
# Internal vs External Scans
Internal scans are conducted from inside the network, while external scans are conducted from outside the network. Let's see a few of their differences below.

| Internal Scans                                                                                      | External Scans                                                                    |

| Conducted from inside the network.                                                                  | Conducted from outside the network.                                               |
| It focuses on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited inside the network.                         | It focuses on the vulnerabilities that can be exploited from outside the network. |
| Identifies vulnerabilities that would be exposed to the attackers once they get inside the network. | Identifies the vulnerabilities exposed to the attacker from outside the network.  |
# CVE
CVE or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures is a publicly available list of known cyber security vulnerabilities in software and hardware, each assigned a unique ID.
# CVSS
CVSS or Common Vulnerabilities Scoring System is an open industry-standard framework that provides a numerical score (0-10) to assess and communicate the severity of software security vulnerabilities.

| CVSS Score Range | Severity Levels |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| 0.0-3.9          | Low             |
| 4.0-6.9          | Medium          |
| 7.0-8.9          | High            |
| 9.0-10           | Critical        |
